## Equilinox Mod Kit
**The Equilinox Mod Loader is an open source API that makes [Equilinox](https://www.equilinox.com) modable.** It is part of the Equilinox Mod Kit Project that also maintains the Equilinox Mod Kit, the official EMK wiki, documentation and website, as well as other Equilinox modding related repositories here on GitHub.

*The Equilinox Mod Loader is currently in beta testing. Snapshot releases are available on [Discord](https://discord.gg/mnEUuap).*

#### Installing the EML
Download the latest Equilinox Mod Loader jar [here](https://github.com/EquilinoxModKit/Equilinox-Mod-Loader/releases) and place it into your Equilinox installation directory. Run the EML by using the executable script file that fits your operating system. On first execution two folders will be created: `natives` and `mods`; install mods by drag an dropping them into the latter one. In the execution directory, a `.log` file is created after every execution which you should include in any support requests.
Note: If Equilinox was started using the EML, vanilla saves will shop up as corrupted and the other way around. Equilinox wiill promt you to delete them. As far as we can tell, save games are not corrupted though and simply aren't compatible between the modded and vanilla version of the game.
