The Equilinox Mod Loader is a simple application that adds mod support to the indie game [Equilinox](https://www.equilinox.com) which was developed 
single-handedly by Karl Wimble ([ThinMatrix](https://equilinox.com/presskit/index.php)). It is part of the Equilinox Mod Kit Project aiming to bring 
simple and straightforward modding support to Equilinox.

If you are into creating mods and want to add to this awesome community head over to the 
[Equilinox Mod Kit](https://github.com/EquilinoxModKitProject/Equilinox-Mod-Kit) repository for detailed tutorials about how to start modding.

*The Equilinox Mod Loader and Mod Kit currently are in public beta and rough edges are to be expected.*

#### Installing the Equilinox Mod Loader
Download the latest jar file from the [release section](https://github.com/EquilinoxModKitProject/Equilinox-Mod-Loader/releases) and place it in 
your Equilinox installation directory. If you already have Java installed you can run the Equilinox Mod Loader by simply double-clicking it - it 
really is a walk in the park.<br>
For more detailed instructions visit the 
[Wiki page](https://github.com/EquilinoxModKitProject/Equilinox-Mod-Loader/wiki/Installing-the-Equilinox-Mod-Loader).

#### Installing mods
If you already have downloaded a mod it's as simple as navigating to the Equilinox installation directory 
([how to](https://github.com/EquilinoxModKitProject/Equilinox-Mod-Loader/wiki/Installing-the-Equilinox-Mod-Loader#finding-out-where-equilinox-is-installed)) 
and copying the jar file into the `mods` folder (if there is no such folder create it or run the Equilinox Mod Loader once). The Equilinox Mod 
Loader searches this directory for mods and will attempt to load them; you can check if a mod has been loaded correctly by opening the `emk.log` 
file or checking the in-game mod browser.
