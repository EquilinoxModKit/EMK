### About
The idea of creating a modding API for Equilinox arose in early 2018 when it became obvious, that Equilinox' sandbox style gameplay was a prime candidate for content and functionality expansions. The project was afoot and the idea of creating a simple to use - both for modders and users - API, capable of extensively expanding the playing experience of Equilinox, became a reality.
